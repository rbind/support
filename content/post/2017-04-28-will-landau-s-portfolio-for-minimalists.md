I am delighted to share my online blog and portfolio, [will-landau.com](http://will-landau.com) (also [wlandau.github.io](https://wlandau.github.io)). The [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) functionality originally inspired me to build it, and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) has powered it since 2012. After agonizing over the design for years, I finally chose the [slim theme](https://github.com/syaning/slim) by [Alex Shum](http://syaning.com), plus a few added niceties such as the [Ubuntu font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_(typeface)). Now, I can totally focus on the content, unobstructed by cumbersome aesthetic-related code and confident that the layout is solid and easy to maintain.

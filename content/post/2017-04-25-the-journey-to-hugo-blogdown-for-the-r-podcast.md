When I launched the [R-Podcast](https://www.r-podcast.org) back in 2012, my main goal was to create content that illustrates the power and capabilities of R for both those who are new to statistical computing and those who already have extensive experience with R and/or other software used for statistics and data science.  On top of producing content via audio podcasts, it was important for me to create a robust and comprehensive online presence to communicate with my listeners and share additional details and resources to augment the podcast episodes.  Like many podcasters, I chose Wordpress as it seemed to always be the top recommendation for creating a website for those new to podcasting.  While Wordpress does provide a decent interface geared towards those who have little or no background in web development, it was nearly impossible to customize the platform to my evolving needs as key advancements such as [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/), [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), and [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) came to fruition. As I started to embrace markdown for authoring content I found that a class of web authoring platforms called static-site generators could give me the customization of the R-Podcast website that I was looking for.

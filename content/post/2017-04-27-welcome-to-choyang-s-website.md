So, you want start a personal website? And you are an R user? Then the R package [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) is the best choice to create a static website that is generated from plain Markdown or R Markdown documents. 

My website was build with the [academic](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic) framework, a perfect theme for personal or academic websites, and is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I made some customization according to personal needs, such as customizing the homepage widgets, changing website icon and enabling multilingual feature (both English and Simplified Chinese). The source code of my website is at [https://github.com/rbind/choyang](https://github.com/rbind/choyang). For more details on [hugo-academic](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic) please [check out the latest demo](http://gcushen.github.io/hugo-academic-demo/).

Though my website is still very young, I will use it to share my projects and publications, as well as posts mostly related to experiences in R learning and bioinformatics analyis on microbiome.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any qeustion. 

Let's go!
